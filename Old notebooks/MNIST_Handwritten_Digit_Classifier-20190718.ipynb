    "This notebook uses a number (presently 2) different approachs to classify handwritten digits (zero through nine) in the MNIST dataset. A detailed description of the dataset and a catolog of previous analysis on the datset can be found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. The first approach applies logistic regression as a one-vs-all multi-class classification. This approach is fully developed and acheived around an 10% error rate, which is expected for the simplicity of the logistic regression approach and the fact that I didn't overly optimize the number of iterations and tune the hyperparameters. The second approach utilized a 3-layer neural network with a softmax function as the final activation layer, which is all coded in tensorflow. Using 300 hidden units, the network acheives an error rate of X%, which is comparable to a similar network's error rate tested in \tLeCun et al. 1998.\n",

The lowest error on the dataset was 0.23 from using a 35 layer neural network. Granted, the error calculated above is only for classifying a single digit, while the 0.23 is for classifying all digits. One potential reason why our single digit classifer is doing so well could be do to the low frequency of positive events (y=1).

    "The power of the tensorflow framework can be seen as there is no need to specify a back propagation function. The tensor flow objects create are arranged in a computational graph, whose structure allows tensorflow to perform backpropagation automatically. Additionally, using more advanced optimization and initialization algorithms like Adam optimaization and Xavier initialization are a simple as changing a few words in a line of code. I am still learning how to fully understand how the various objects fit together, but it seems a very powerful tool.\n",

    "The number of hidden units has been varied from 60 to 300. A 300 hidden unit neural network can be compared with the 3-layer 300 hidden unit (plus some additional complexity that I haven't delved into) models described here - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. The 3-layer 300 hidden unit network listed on the website had an error rate of 3%. This compares with the 2.3% error rate of the network above. "
